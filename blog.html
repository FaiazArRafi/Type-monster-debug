                            There are two main types of browser storages: session and local storage. They both have
                            their own unique benefits and drawbacks that are good to understand. <br>
                            Their main difference is that local storage data does not expire, whereas session storage
                            data gets cleared when the user closes its browser window.
                            Page sessions are valid for only one tab at a time. So, if a user has three tabs open, each
                            one will have its own page session.
                            Since local storage is not session-based, all the data must be deleted via javascript or
                            manually.<br> In conclusion, local storage is best for storing data you want to keep long
                            term,
                            even after the user has closed the tab or browser.

                            Session storage is best for storing temporary data or data that should only be accessible
                            from one tab.

                            When a variable is globally scoped, it means it is available from anywhere in the program.
                            Declaring a variable outside a function or a block leads to it being
                            globally scoped. <br>
                            When variables are declared within a block, they are block scoped. It means that they can
                            only be accessed inside the block they were declared in. <br>
                            Data sharing is possible in global scope as multiple functions can access the same global
                            variable. On the other hand data sharing is not possible in block scope as data can be
                            accessed by only one function. <br>
                            Global scope memory storage is stored on a fixed location decided by the compiler. Block
                            scope memory storage is stored on the stack unless specified.

                            The event loop is a process that waits for the Call Stack to be clear before pushing
                            callbacks from the Task Queue to the Call Stack. Once the Stack is clear, the event loop
                            triggers and checks the Task Queue for available callbacks. If there are any, it pushes it
                            to the Call Stack, waits for the Call Stack to be clear again, and repeats the same process.
                            <br>
                            In simple, the Event Loop job is to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the
                            Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push
                            it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it.
                            Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop. Each event is just a function
                            callback.
